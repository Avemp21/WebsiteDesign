  <p>Monkeys are found in different forms, sizes, and colors all over the globe.
Over 260 distinct species of monkeys have been identified. New World and Old World are the two main divisions. Old World monkeys are found in Asia and Africa, whereas New World monkeys are found in North and South America and Europe. Old World monkeys do not have prehensile tails, while New World monkeys have. This is one of the major differences between the two groups. The cheeks of Old World monkeys are equipped with unique pouches for storing food. Although both Old and New World monkeys have rump pads, only the former has them. Also, the nostrils of Old World monkeys are tiny, bent, and closely spaced; those of New World monkeys, on the other hand, are large, spherical, and widely apart.</p>

              <p>Despite popular belief, monkeys don't simply live off of bananas. Monkeys eat a wide variety of things. As a result, they only consume animal products and plant-based meals. Nuts, fruits, seeds, and flowers are the most common food items for monkeys. Monkeys have been seen to consume tiny lizards, insects, spiders, and even bird eggs as a source of protein.</p>

              <!-- Description -->
              <p>The majority of monkeys are arboreal, although some may be found on the plains or in the mountains. In order to obtain food, monkey tribes are always on the move.
              
              Monkeys are very social creatures. Missions, tribes, armies, and cartloads are all terms used to describe groups of monkeys. The young monkeys in the troop will be cared for by a troop working together. They enjoy each other's company, as well as playing, cuddling, and protecting one another.
